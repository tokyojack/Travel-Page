# Travel-Page
A landing-page for a traveling website made with Gulp.

I made this during one of my many coding courses.

INSTRUCTIONS:

BEFORE: Made sure you've download Nodejs first.

1. Clone this repo ```git clone https://github.com/tokyojack/Travel-Page```
2. Open a CMD and redirect to the path (cd C:/..)
3. Run ```npm install``` for the packages
4. do "gulp watch" in the CMD
5. A new tab should open and you can check out the website.

Now you've just install the program! Raise your dongers ```ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ```!
