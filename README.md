<p>align="center">A landing-page for a traveling website made with Gulp</p>
<p>I made this during one of my many coding courses</p> 

<br/>

## Installing

1. Clone this repo ```git clone https://github.com/tokyojack/Travel-Page```
2. Run ```npm install``` for the packages
3. Do "gulp watch" in console
4. A new tab will open and then you're able to check it out.

Now you've just install the program! Wow, I'm excited to see how much time Gulp will save me ```(ง°ل͜°)ง```
